The CMNA workshop series focuses on the general issue of modelling "natural" argumentation.

<!--However, to celebrate our co-location with COMMA, this year we have introduced a special theme on *explorations of the relationship between logic programming and computational models of natural argument*. Our theme should be interpreted broadly, to reflect the wide range of approaches to recognising, formalising, and understanding the richness of real-world reasoning and communication processes within computational models. 

Nothwithstanding the special theme, we also solicit contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following areas of interest: -->

 Contributions are solicited addressing, but not limited to, the following areas of interest:

* The characteristics of “natural” arguments (e.g. ontological aspects, cognitive issues, legal aspects).
* The linguistic characteristics of natural argumentation, including discourse markers, sentence format, referring expressions, and style.
* The generation of natural argument
* Corpus argumentation results and techniques
* Argumentation mining
* Models of natural legal argument
* Rhetoric and affect: the role of emotions, personalities, etc. in argumentation.
* The roles of licentiousness and deceit and the ethical implications of implemented systems demonstrating such features.
* Natural argumentation in multi-agent systems.
* Methods to better convey the structure of complex argument, including representation and summarisation.
* Natural argumentation and media: visual arguments, multi-modal arguments, spoken arguments.
* Evaluative arguments and their application in AI systems (such as decision-support and advice-giving).
* Non-monotonic, defeasible and uncertain argumentation.
* The computational use of models from informal logic and argumentation theory.
* Computer supported collaborative argumentation, for pedagogy, e-democracy and public debate.
* Tools for interacting with structures of argument.
* Applications of argumentation based systems.
