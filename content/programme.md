# Invited Speaker (13:45-14:30 CET)

**Title:** The Dynamics of Knowledge: Argumentation and Belief Revision

**Speaker:** Guillermo R. Simari, Universidad Nacional del Sur

**Abstract:** The exploration of the relationships between belief revision and computational argumentation has led to significant contributions for both areas; several techniques employed in belief revision are being studied to formalize the dynamics of argumentation frameworks and the capabilities of the argumentation-based defeasible reasoning are being used to define belief change operators. By briefly considering the fundamental ideas of both areas it is possible to examine some of the mutually beneficial cross-application in different proposals that model reasoning mechanisms that combine contributions from the two domains.

# Closing Seminar (18:00-19:00 BST)

This year we've coordinated with the [interdisciplinary monthly online speaker series on the ethics of argumentation](https://argumentethics2021.wixsite.com/argumentationethics) for the closing seminar. We'll share the link to that seminar to all CMNA delegates and invite them to join that event immediately after the close of CMNA'21.

**Title:** Sources of Opinion: The Community of Knowledge and How to Take Advantage of Outsourcing

**Speaker:** [Steven A. Sloman](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ssloman), [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/)

**Abstract:** People have some crazy opinions. Generally, these are the opinions that we disagree with. The standard view in both academia and the wider culture is that people have such opinions due to knowledge deficits; they are lacking information. On this view, providing information and critical reasoning skills is the best way to get opinions to converge, because they’ll converge to the truth. There is already strong reason to doubt this deficit model. I provide more in the form of evidence that knowledge is unrelated to attitudes about issues. In contrast, a person’s ideology influences both their attitudes and their sense of understanding. A competitor to the deficit model, the cultural cognition view, explains the effect of ideology on attitudes, but does not address the sense of understanding. I follow the cultural cognition view in proposing that people outsource much of their reasoning to their communities; I add that it is the resulting sense of understanding that mediates their attitudes. This community of knowledge suggests that people outsource most of their reasoning. I show how this fact can be deployed to bring evidence to bear on policy.
